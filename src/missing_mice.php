<h4>The following mice are missing (from most tools based on crowd sourced data) due to several factors:</h4>
1) They are bonus mice (prize/RH/etc) (which I don't support yet)<br/>
2) They are new, and no one has caught them yet with the extension<br/>
3) Mouse is a transition mouse between places and it's impossible to accurately determine where it was caught. <br/>(This will hopefully be solved when MH Devs add API in MH 4.0)
