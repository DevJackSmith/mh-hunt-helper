Next things I'm planning to work on (as time permits):
-Adding remaining stages to each location that needs them (Frift, SG, Spill, Brift, Frox, Train, Twisted Garden, Sand Crypts, Cursed City)
-Adding more search boxes to be able to filter data by location, setup, etc.
-Move the site to a more reliable host and a better url

Known issues:
1. Last mouse before auto-travel get wrong location
2. The free host I am using is not very reliable, and has older mysql/php
