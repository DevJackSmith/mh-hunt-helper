Next things I'm planning to work on (as time permits):
-Adding remaining stages to each location that needs them
-Adding ajax to attraction page, so to only load table, not whole page
-Making mouse select box editable with autocomplete (700+ mice is not going to be a good dropdown)
-Adding more search boxes to be able to filter data by location, setup, etc.

Finished Updates (newest first):
-Added LG, Sand Dunes, Lost City, Balack's Cove, Iceberg stages (v1.4)
-Added Fiery Warpath stages (v1.3)
-Added Labyrinth hallway stages (v1.2)
-Refactored intake to remove repetetive code
-Added loader animation
-Fixed some regex on mice names, so they don't show anything but mice names
-Made the extension only capture latest hunt by player, as trap setup is not known for other hunts
-Put the extension in the Chrome Store for easy availability and auto updates
-Made everything open source by putting it on GitHub
-Setup git repository to keep track of changes
-Added meaningful server response messages
-Added validation on server and client side to minimize server load
-Successfully installed and tested Chrome extension in Opera and Firefox
-Made the site responsive for mobile phones
-Created quick and dirty attraction webpage to see a bit of data
-Created simple database and intake api
-Created quick and dirty Chrome extension (for non-facebook site only) (v1.0)
