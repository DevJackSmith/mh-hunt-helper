Next things I'm planning to work on (as time permits):
-Adding more search boxes to be able to filter data by location, setup, etc.
-Add Map Helper autopopulate (and maybe Tsitu's map tool autopopulate)

Known issues:
1. Last mouse before auto-travel gets wrong location (example riptide)
2. The free host I am using is not very reliable
3. Auto disarming charms and cheese, don't get recorded for the hunt.
