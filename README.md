# mh-hunt-helper

This extension collects hunt info for popular MouseHunt game. The collected info (like trap, cheese, charm, base, mouse, location) will be used in the future. The goal is to create a crowd sourced data for a catch rate and attraction rate calculator website.

 - Only works on https://www.mousehuntgame.com
 - Only submits game information (no player names, or anything else)
 - Only submits hunts when player sounded the horn, not friend or trap check.
 - Only reads and collects data, does not change/display anything.

Special thanks to all who helped.
