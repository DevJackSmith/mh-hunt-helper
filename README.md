# mh-hunt-helper

This extension collects hunt info for popular MouseHunt game. The collected info (like trap, cheese, charm, base, mouse, location) will be used in the future. The goal is to create a crowd sourced data for a catch rate and attraction rate calculator website.

 - Only submits game information (no player names, or anything like that)
 - Only submits hunts when player sounded the horn, not friend or trap check.
 - Only reads and collects data, does not change anything in the game.

Special thanks to all who helped. Few honorable mentions: Aardwolf, Tsitu's tools team, Loaf, Groupsky, Nick (HornTracker), and many others who helped with advice, ideas, and otherwise. Also thanks to contributors and discord mods.

This tool uses some of the [Tsitu's scripts](https://github.com/tsitu/MH-Tools/) to autopopulate their site from extension.
